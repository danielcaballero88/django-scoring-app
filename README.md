# Django Scoring App

Django app to keep scores in boardgames like Agricola or Wingspan.

# WIP Boards

The idea is as follows:
1. A player clicks on a game in the index. They goes to the add_board view.
2. They add the scorers for that board and that game and click save/start. They go to the board table view.
3. They enter the values for each scorer and scoring category, click done, and the totals are calculated.
4. Maybe show some animation for the podium?
